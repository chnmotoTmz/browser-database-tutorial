{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"JavaScript","Original Requirements":"Develop a browser-based SQLite app with client-side data management using MetaGPT's automated software development pipeline.","Project Name":"browser_sqlite_app","Product Goals":["Create a user-friendly interface for data entry and retrieval.","Ensure data integrity and security on the client-side.","Enable efficient data management and manipulation."],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to add new records to the database.","As a user, I want to be able to view existing records in a tabular format.","As a user, I want to be able to update existing records.","As a user, I want to be able to delete records.","As a user, I want to search for specific records based on criteria."],"Competitive Analysis":["App A: Simple interface, lacks advanced search features.","App B: Robust data management, but complex UI.","App C: Good data security, but slow performance.","App D: User-friendly interface, but limited data types.","App E: Supports multiple data types, but lacks offline functionality."],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"User Experience vs. Functionality\"\n    x-axis \"Low Functionality\" --> \"High Functionality\"\n    y-axis \"Poor UX\" --> \"Excellent UX\"\n    quadrant-1 \"Focus on improving functionality\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Prioritize UX improvements\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate the product strategy\"\n    quadrant-4 \"Potential for optimization\"\n    \"App A\": [0.2, 0.3]\n    \"App B\": [0.8, 0.6]\n    \"App C\": [0.7, 0.2]\n    \"App D\": [0.4, 0.7]\n    \"App E\": [0.9, 0.5]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.6, 0.8]","Requirement Analysis":"The application needs to handle user input, validate data, store it in an SQLite database, and present it in a user-friendly way.  Client-side data management implies that data manipulation and validation will occur within the user's browser, reducing server load and improving responsiveness.  Security measures should be implemented to protect user data.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement user authentication and authorization."],["P1","Develop data validation and sanitization routines."],["P2","Create a user-friendly data entry form."],["P3","Implement a search functionality with filtering options."],["P4","Implement data display in a sortable table."]],"UI Design draft":"The UI will feature a simple, clean design.  A table will display data, with buttons for adding, editing, deleting, and searching.  Input fields will be clearly labeled, and error messages will be displayed for invalid data.  A navigation bar will allow users to easily access different sections of the app.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Specific data types and constraints for the SQLite database are not defined.  Further details on the expected data volume and user base would be helpful."}
