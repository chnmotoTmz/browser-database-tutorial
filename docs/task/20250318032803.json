The `UIHandler` class is responsible for displaying records and handling user input.  The `Record` class defines the structure of the data stored in the database.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Specific data types and constraints for the SQLite database are not defined.  Further details on the expected data volume and user base would be helpful.  Also, the security measures for client-side data management need to be further elaborated.  How will data validation and sanitization be implemented to prevent injection attacks?  What are the specific fields and data types for each record?  What are the expected constraints (e.g., length limits, data types)?  Defining these aspects will allow for a more robust and secure implementation.  The exact structure of the HTML forms and the JavaScript functions for handling user input need to be further specified."}
